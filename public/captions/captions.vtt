00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.392
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.976
Okay, for real, take a second you got to feel this to learn it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.976
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal. Okay?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.976
Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.976
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.712
Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.976
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.696
Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.200
Well, bad news,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.976
you should have kept your mouth shut.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.976
Because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.656
The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.976
Anytime you have a goal, there's some steps that need to be done some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.976
Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.976
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.976
psychologists have found that it's called a social reality, the mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.976
And then because you felt that satisfaction,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.776
you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.976
So this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals, right, so they hold it to hold us to it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.976
Yeah.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.800
So let's look at the proof.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.976
1926 Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology called this substitution

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.568
1933. For a Mueller found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.976
1982 Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.520
And in 2009, he did some new tests that were published,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.120
goes like this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.533
163 People across four separate tests,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.667
everyone wrote down their personal goal,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.504
then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room and half didn't.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.976
And then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.976
but they were told that they could stop at any time.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.976
Now, those who kept their mouth shut, worked the entire 45 minutes on average.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.976
And when asked afterwards

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.976
said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.976
But those who had announced it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.533
quit after only 33 minutes on average.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.976
And when asked afterwards said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.333
So if this is true, what can we do?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.840
Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.976
You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.672
And you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.976
But if you do need to talk about something,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.976
you can state it in a way that gives you know satisfaction.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.232
Such as I really want to run this marathon so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't. Okay.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.976
So audience next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.440
what will you say?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.520
Exactly, well done.
