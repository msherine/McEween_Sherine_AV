TED talks are recorded live at the TED conference.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.136
This episode features entrepreneur, Derek Sivers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.600
Here's Derek Sivers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.392
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.976
Okay, for real, you can take a second you got to feel this to learn it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.976
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal. Okay?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.976
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.648
Imagine their congratulations in their high image of you.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.976
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.696
Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.976
Well, bad news, you should have kept your mouth shut.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.976
Because that good feeling now we'll make you less likely to do it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.656
The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.976
Anytime you have a goal, there's some steps that need to be done some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.976
Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.976
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.976
psychologists have found that it's called a social reality,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.976
the mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.656
And then because you felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.976
So this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals, right, so they hold it to hold us to it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200
Yeah. So let's look at the proof.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
1926 Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology called this substitution 1933 for $1 found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.976
1982 Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.520
And in 2009, he did some new tests that were published,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.016
goes like this 163 People across four separate tests, everyone wrote down their personal goal,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.504
then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room and half didn't.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.976
And then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.976
but they were told that they could stop at any time.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.976
Now, those who kept their mouth shut, worked the entire 45 minutes on average.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.976
And when asked afterwards said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.416
But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes on average.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.976
And when asked afterwards said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.333
So if this is true, what can we do?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.840
Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.976
You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.976
And you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.592
But if you do need to talk about something, you can state it in a way that gives you know satisfaction.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.976
Such as I really want to run this marathon so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.632
Okay. So audience next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.440
Exactly well done.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.184
That was Derek Sivers, recorded at TED Global 2010 in Oxford, England, July 2010.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.800
